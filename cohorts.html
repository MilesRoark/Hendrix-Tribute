            <li>
              <p class="father">James "Al" Allen Hendrix (1919–2002):</p>
              <p>
                Jimi’s father, often referred to as Al, was a significant figure
                in Jimi's life. <br />
                After serving in World War II, Al returned to Seattle and raised
                Jimi and his siblings.<br />
                He was supportive of Jimi’s musical career and managed his
                estate after his death.<br />
                Al Hendrix is remembered for his efforts to preserve and protect
                his son's legacy.

              <p class="mother">Lucille Jeter Hendrix (1925–1958):</p>
              <p>
                Jimi’s mother, Lucille, had a troubled life and struggled with
                health issues, including <br />alcoholism. She separated from Al
                Hendrix when Jimi was young<br />
                and passed away when Jimi was 15. Despite their strained
                relationship, Jimi had a <br />deep affection for his mother,
                and her death had a profound impact on him.

              <p class="brother">Leon Hendrix (b. 1948)</p>
              <p>
                Jimi’s younger brother, Leon, had a close relationship with Jimi
                during their childhood.<br />
                Like Jimi, Leon faced challenges growing up, including
                difficulties with education and<br />
                legal issues. After Jimi's death, Leon became involved in music
                and the family’s legal battles<br />
                over Jimi's estate. He has also written a book<br />
                about his brother, titled Jimi Hendrix: A Brother's Story.

                physical and <br />mental disabilities, Joseph was placed in
                foster care as a child and did not have<br />

                he <br />
                married her mother, a woman named Ayako "June" Fujita.<br />
                Kathy was raised as Jimi's sister, although they were not
                biologically related. <br />After Al Hendrix's death, Kathy
                (Janie) became the head of Experience Hendrix,<br />
                the company that manages Jimi Hendrix's estate and legacy.
